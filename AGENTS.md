# Repository Guidelines for Agents

## Changelog maintenance
- Whenever you make a change that affects user-visible behavior, documentation shipped to end users, or release metadata, update `CHANGELOG.md`.
- Add the entry under the `Unreleased` section using a short descriptive bullet. If the section is missing, create it at the top of the changelog.
- If a change is strictly internal (e.g., refactors, CI tweaks), note that no changelog update is needed in your summary so reviewers understand the omission.
